// Generated for you: ordinary Three.js; ThreeNative does not read this file. Delete or rewrite
// it freely — the tiers below are a starting point, not a framework look.
//
// This is the one place this game decides how expensive it looks. `postprocessing.ts` reads
// `qualityPreset(resolveQualityTier(...))` and nothing else, so "make it run on a phone" is one
// file to edit rather than a hunt through anonymous literals. All three tiers use the World
// Environment's shared SMAA stage; see `screenSpaceAA` in `worldEnvironment.ts`.
//
// **Where the numbers come from.** Every millisecond below is GPU time from the per-stage
// ablation recorded in the engine repository's `docs/verification/runtime-perf-state.md`: Chrome
// on an RTX 2080, 1600x900, static build, `gpuMs` read from three's `timestamp-query`. The
// per-stage figures oversum — removing SSGI also removes the denoise passes the later stages
// sample — so read each as *what turning this one off gave back*, not as a share of a partition.
// A stage nobody has ablated on its own says `unmeasured` rather than guessing, and your scene is
// not that scene: read `TN_FRAME_BUDGET` back after you change a tier.
//
// One cost that is **not** a stage here and outweighs most of them: the prefiltered reflection
// probe on `scene.environment`, measured at **~6.3 ms of an 18-19 ms Pixel 8 frame**. It is set
// in `sky.ts`, not in this file.
